VS Code settings

This is my preferred VS Code settings. This further customizes the official `Github Dark Default` theme.

To apply these custom theme settings, go to `file` -> `preferences` -> `settings`, and then type 'settings' in the search input, and look for the option that says: `Edit in settings.json`.
Then copy-paste these custom values.

Note that duplicate fields might occur, so just remove the duplicates to get rid of the warnings.
